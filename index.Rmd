# This is a Heading {#link_of_header}
<!-- This is a comment --> 
<!-- add a hash to the headings line to make it smaller, remove one to make it bigger. Remember spaces! --> 

## Inline text formating

to make text bold use **double asterisks** or __double underscore__

to make text italic use *asterisks* or _underscore_

to make text superscript use ^pointyuparrows^

to make text subscript use ~tilde~

to mark text as inlike code use `backticks`

to use strikethrough use ~~double tilde~~

## Line breaks

To separate lines

\

use back slashes



# Links + lists
Linking to website put the link in [square brackets, followed by the link in ()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

[Link to shared document] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N8gPLlwWvviLO4S4v5DgsZrafEeV2r4IeHu3KHDrWNc/edit#)



[Link to first heading](#link_of_header) - for this to work, the link_to_header must be in {} next to the header with one #.  

\

## Footnotes

To indicate a footnote use [^1] and a second footnote [^2]

[^1]: this is the first footnote
[^2]: this is the second

\

## Lists

Ordered lists (for sublists use 4 spaces to indent item)

1. Golden Oriole
2. Cat
3. Black Blood
    a. Enhanced Black Blood
4. White Honey

Unordered lists (*, +, -):

- School of the Bear
- School of the Wolf
    - School of the Cat
- School of the Viper

Task list

Task lists can be done in the following syntax:

 - [ ] an unchecked task list item
 
 - [x] a checked task list item 

\

# Inserting figures
put figures you want in an img folder of the project you're working on.

# Tables
Use | and - to create a table as follows:

| Column 1     | Column 2     |
| ------------ | ------------ | 
| Obi-Wan      | Master       | 
| Anakin       | Padawan      |

| Left align  | Center align | Right align  |
| :---        |    :----:    |         ---: |
| Item 1,1    | Item 1,2     | Item 1,3     | 
| Item 2,1    | Item 2,2     | Item 2,3     |

For tables with more than two columns, include these : in the way seen above. For big tables, these are not really particularly efficient or useful. 

# Blocks

## Text Blocks

> For blocks, use a right-pointing angle bracket
>
> to make it more than one line, always start with the bracket

## Code blocks
Use three backticks (```) for enclosing things in a code block

```
print("Hello World!")
x = c(1,2,3)
print(x)
```
\

# Creating a table of contents
Go to the top of the document, as it applies to all the page. Use this code at the top of the page:
```
output:
    html_document:
        toc: true
```

Can change the depth of the heading with 
```
toc_depth: 4
```
This code above displays the table of contents at the top of the page, to get it as a sidebar that moves as you scroll:
```
toc_float: true
```
So the total code is:
```
output:
    html_document:
        toc: true
        toc_depth: 4
        toc_float: true
```
Be precise with the spacing in this. ALSO be aware with the floating sidebar of a contents table, it is very sensitive to the hashes on the headings, so make sure that all the headings you want are visible. 
\

# References examples
Put references into a text file in the same sort of format as visible in the one on here. Upload the references to the R session. 
\
Go into the yaml section and add under the date: 
```
bibliography: references.bib
link-citation: yes
```
Citation to a paper @cardona2019 and @cardona2014
\
Then put the references at the bottom of the doc with the # key.

# Challenges 1 + 2

## 1,500 scientists lift the lid on reproducibility

##### Monya Baker

##### 25 May 2016

## Survey sheds light on 'crisis' rocking research

**More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce other scientist's experiments**, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments. Those are some of the telling figures that emerged from *Nature*'s survey of 1,576 researchers who took a brief online questionnaire on reproducibility in research.

The data reveal sometimes-contradictory attitudes towards reproducibility. Although 52% of those surveyed agree that there is a significant 'crisis' of reproducibility, less than 31% think that failure to reproduce published results means that the result is probably wrong, and most say that they still trust the published literature.

(to do this in a new website, put the first three headings under 'challenge' in the title, author and date sections respectively at the top of the page.)

### The Survey

In the survey [^3] respondents were asked to rate 11 different approaches to improving reproducibilty in science. Below is the list order by the most highly rated:

- Better understanding of statistics
- Better mentoring/supervision
- More robust design
- Better teaching
- More within-lab validation
- Incentives for better practice
- Incentives for formal reproduction
- More external-lab validation
- More time for mentoring
- Journals enforcing standards
- More time checking notebooks
